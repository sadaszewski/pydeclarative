# PyDeclarative

PyDeclarative is a new SPA framework for Python which inherits the best 
elements of  Shiny/Shiny for Python and Qt Modeling Language (QML) in
order to allow inline  mixing of UI and logic elements; seamless reactive
programming with minimal added verbosity; and compositional syntactic
uniformity which delivers unparalleled flexibility in Dependency
Injection/Inversion of Control mechanisms and refactoring capabilities.

## Citation

If you are using this software and would be so kind to please cite
the [PyDeclarative paper](https://zenodo.org/records/12497154)
in your research - that would be great.

Here is how a citation could look like in Bibtex format:
```
@article{adaszewski2024pydeclarative,
  author  = "Adaszewski, S.",
  title   = "PyDeclarative: a Declarative Single Page Application Framework for Python",
  journal = "Zenodo",
  year    = 2024,
  doi     = "10.5281/zenodo.12497154"
}
```

I am working on publishing the paper in a peer-reviewed journal.

Here is the very first version ever to leave my PC - [PyDeclarative paper](paper/pydeclarative_paper_adaszewski_2024_final_20240530_timestamped.pdf)
and the [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/) timestamp for the PDF:
[timestamp](paper/pydeclarative_paper_adaszewski_2024_final_20240530_timestamped.pdf.ots).
