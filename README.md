# PyDeclarative

PyDeclarative is a new SPA framework for Python which inherits the best 
elements of  Shiny/Shiny for Python and Qt Modeling Language (QML) in
order to allow inline  mixing of UI and logic elements; seamless reactive
programming with minimal added verbosity; and compositional syntactic
uniformity which delivers unparalleled flexibility in Dependency
Injection/Inversion of Control mechanisms and refactoring capabilities.

## Citation

If you are using this software and would be so kind to please cite
the [PyDeclarative paper](paper/pydeclarative_paper_adaszewski_2024_final_20240530_timestamped.pdf)
in your research - that would be great.

Here is how a citation could look like in Bibtex format for the moment:
```
@misc{adaszewski_pydeclarative_2024,
  author = {Adaszewski, Stanislaw},
  title = {{PyDeclarative: a declarative Single Page Application framework for Python}},
  year = {2024},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/sadaszewski/pydeclarative}}
}
```

I am working on publishing the paper on arXiv. If/when that happens, I would appreciate
changing the references to point to that location.

Here is the [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/) timestamp for the article PDF:
